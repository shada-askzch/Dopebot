# How to Build Skills

## What is a skill?

A skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file and optionally script files. The agent teaches itself how to use them by reading the SKILL.md, then runs the scripts via bash. No new tools are registered. No TypeScript. No build step.

Skills work with both Pi and Claude Code — they share the same `skills/active/` directory.

## How skills work

**Where they live**:
- `skills/` — all available skills
- `skills/active/` — symlinks to activated skills (both agents read from here)

**How they load**: On-demand (progressive disclosure). At startup, the agent scans skill directories and puts **only the name + description** from each SKILL.md frontmatter into the system prompt. The full instructions are NOT loaded until the agent decides the skill is relevant and reads the file.

**The complete runtime flow** (using brave-search as example):

1. Agent starts, scans skills, sees `brave-search/SKILL.md`, puts description in system prompt
2. User says "search for python async tutorials"
3. Agent sees the description, decides brave-search is relevant
4. Agent reads the full SKILL.md to learn the commands
5. Agent runs: `skills/brave-search/search.js "python async tutorials"`
6. `search.js` runs as a child process, reads `$BRAVE_API_KEY` from the environment, calls the Brave Search API, prints results to stdout
7. Agent reads results, responds to user

## What's inside a skill folder

Real example: brave-search

```
skills/brave-search/
├── SKILL.md          ← instructions for both agent and human
├── package.json      ← declares npm dependencies
├── search.js         ← Node.js script that calls Brave Search API, prints results to stdout
└── content.js        ← Node.js script that fetches a URL, extracts readable markdown
```

**SKILL.md contents**:
```markdown
---
name: brave-search
description: Web search and content extraction via Brave Search API. Use for searching documentation, facts, or any web content.
---
# Brave Search

## Setup
cd skills/brave-search && npm install

## Search
skills/brave-search/search.js "query"              # Basic search (5 results)
skills/brave-search/search.js "query" -n 10        # More results (max 20)
skills/brave-search/search.js "query" --content    # Include page content as markdown
skills/brave-search/search.js "query" --freshness pw  # Results from last week

## Extract Page Content
skills/brave-search/content.js https://example.com
```

Skills use project-root-relative paths (e.g., `skills/brave-search/search.js`).

**Setup**: Run `npm install` once in the skill directory. The `package.json` declares what dependencies the scripts need. In Docker, dependencies are installed automatically by the entrypoint.

**The skill IS the bundle** — the SKILL.md, the code files, and the package.json all live in one directory.

---

## SKILL.md format

```markdown
---
name: skill-name-in-kebab-case
description: One sentence describing what the skill does and when to use it.
---

# Skill Name

## Usage

```bash
skills/skill-name/script.sh <args>
```
```

- **`name`** — kebab-case, matches the folder name
- **`description`** — appears in the system prompt under "Active skills"
- **Body** — full usage instructions the agent reads on-demand

Use project-root-relative paths in all examples (e.g., `skills/skill-name/script.sh`).

---

## Activation

Skills are activated by symlinking into `skills/active/`:

```bash
ln -s ../skill-name skills/active/skill-name
```

Both `.pi/skills` and `.claude/skills` point to `skills/active/`, so one activation controls both agents.

To deactivate: `rm skills/active/skill-name`

## Building a new skill

### Simple bash skill (most common pattern)

**skills/transcribe/SKILL.md:**
```markdown
---
name: transcribe
description: Speech-to-text transcription using Groq Whisper API. Supports m4a, mp3, wav, ogg, flac, webm.
---

# Transcribe

Speech-to-text using Groq Whisper API.

## Setup
Requires GROQ_API_KEY environment variable.

## Usage
```bash
skills/transcribe/transcribe.sh <audio-file>
```
```

**skills/transcribe/transcribe.sh:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -z "$1" ]; then echo "Usage: transcribe.sh <audio-file>"; exit 1; fi
if [ -z "$GROQ_API_KEY" ]; then echo "Error: GROQ_API_KEY not set"; exit 1; fi
curl -s -X POST "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@${1}" \
  -F "model=whisper-large-v3-turbo" \
  -F "response_format=text"
```

### Skill with Node.js dependencies

The built-in `brave-search` skill uses Node.js for HTML parsing (jsdom, readability, turndown). It has a `package.json` and `.js` scripts. Dependencies are installed automatically in Docker. Use this pattern only when bash + curl isn't sufficient.

---

## Bundled skills

Skills are bundled in `templates/skills/` and scaffolded into user projects by `npx thepopebot init`:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| brave-search | Web search and content extraction via Brave Search API |
| google-docs | Create and manage Google Docs on a shared drive via service account |
| google-drive | Google Drive operations (list, upload, download, delete) via service account |
| kie-ai | AI image and video generation via kie.ai API |
| get-secret | List available LLM-accessible credentials |
| youtube-transcript | YouTube transcript extraction |

## Where to find more skills

**External skills repo**: `https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills`

Additional skills available there: gccli (Google Calendar), gmcli (Gmail), subagent, transcribe, vscode.

These skills follow the **Agent Skills standard** (SKILL.md format), compatible with Pi, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Amp, and Droid.

---

## Credential setup

If a skill needs an API key, add it via the admin UI (Settings > Agent Jobs > Secrets). The secret will be injected as an env var into Docker containers. The agent can discover available secrets via the `get-secret` skill.

---

## Security note

Skills run via bash. The agent has access to environment variables, which means it could `echo $BRAVE_API_KEY` if it wanted to. Protected secrets (AGENT_* prefix) are filtered from the bash environment by the env-sanitizer extension. LLM-accessible secrets (AGENT_LLM_* prefix) are deliberately left available for skills to use.
